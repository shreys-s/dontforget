==========

1 Project

Online TODO list You are required to build a simple online TODO list (see: remembermilk.com) with a web interface that can be used in all popular web browsers.

The application has to support multiple users, store necessary data in a database and be built with Java Servlet technology (use of open-source frameworks is also allowed).

2 Minimal functionality

- User can sign in using unique login and password. This can be hardcoded to a default user list
- User management functionality is not required. Please create at least one account for user 'test' with password 'abc123'.
- User can view his/her current task list
- User can check/uncheck any task on their list
- User can add/remove task
- All changes should be persistent
- When a user signs into the system next time they will see changes made during previous session.
- Each 'task' contains a text description and date when the entry was created. Both fields should be displayed in the UI.
- Since application can be used to by many users, the application should consider performance

3 Your outputs

Please supply WAR file and all source code. WAR file will be deployed and tested in Tomcat6.x (Java6).

You're allowed to use any open-source library/framework, but it has to be included into a final WAR file.

Please use an open-source in-memory database if needed (e.g. HSQL, H2, SQLite)

Please also supply a short (1-2 pages) write up that explains you design choices

- Why certain approaches were used, why others were not used
- Any design patterns you used
- Anything extra you would have done given more time
- Anything else you feel I should know
